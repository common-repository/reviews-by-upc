Get reviews via UPC from SearchReviews.com on your website.

== Description ==

Your visitors love user reviews. Now you can supplement your existing brilliant content with relevant user reviews.

It's really simple: The SearchReviews.com Widget takes a UPC from you and then finds relevant user reviews.

You get:

1. Increased user engagement
2. Boosted SEO from increased time on site
3. More content for your site

== Installation ==

1. Upload `searchreviews_upc.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

Posts and pages have a "SearchReviews.com Widget" meta-box. Just add a UPC to this box to trigger the widget. Using the widget is optional - if you don't add a UPC, the widget won't appear.
